## My github
Github is __not__ where I do any of my work nor have done any of my work (true as of 7/2025).

If you were misguided here from my resume, know that most of these repos are forks/archives of public projects, by other incredible people in the world, that I just play with to do security research on various targets. 

Most of the stuff that I poc is private or scraps in 3 goofily named repositories. 

There might be some capture the flag or pwn2own attempt scraps here or there.
